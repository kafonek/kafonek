Hi, I'm @kafonek (Matt Kafonek) :wave:

I'm a senior Python backend developer at [Noteable](https://noteable.io).  Before that, I was an intel analyst at [VaST](https://www.vast-inc.com/) and a major advocate for empowering domain experts with data science tools like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).

I like to build applications with the modern Python stack.  See what frameworks we're using at Noteable with a small public demo app, [minor-illusion](https://github.com/noteable-io/minor-illusion).
