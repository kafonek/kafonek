Hi, I'm @kafonek (Matt Kafonek) :wave:

My first career was as a domain expert in the intelligence community. I fell into it as a young enlisted [USAF](https://www.airforce.com/) linguist, and kept working in the field for almost twenty years as a geolocation specialist and technical analyst with [VaST](https://www.vast-inc.com/). I began learning Python around 2010 to help automate some day-to-day tasks. As I shared what I learned with other analysts, using tools like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), I developed a passion for empowering domain experts. One part of that is providing "no-code" / "low-code" tools, but an underserved need is giving them the right opportunity to begin learning and using code themselves.

My second career as a software engineer started with [Noteable](https://noteable.io), a managed Notebook platform to make data accessible to all. I learned countless valuable lessons developing and deploying features for a production application. Our backend stack was Python and CockroachDB, with the Kernel compute orchestrated through a Kubernetes Operator and custom resource definitions. When ChatGPT announced the plugin store, and later custom GPTs, we were in a unique position to be first-to-market with a Notebook/coding plugin, which landed on the initial "popular" store. I have seen what happens when a startup catches lightning in a bottle, and it is freaking cool.

My current interests are twofold: learning Rust and becoming more comfortable applying practical AI. I am excited about Rust because its syntax, build tools, and ecosystem are approachable. It's also blazing fast and compact. I believe the future of performant Python is Rust. I think web-assembly has a lot of promise, and Rust has a tremendous story there. As far as AI goes, the experience with Noteable was "magical" but we were effectively just interacting with OpenAI APIs, whether it was ChatGPT making calls to us or our app making calls to OpenAI. I want learn what it's like to deploy and optimize custom models in production.
