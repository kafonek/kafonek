Hi, I'm @kafonek (Matt Kafonek) :wave:

I'm a senior Python backend developer at [Noteable](https://noteable.io).  Before that, I was an intel analyst at [VaST](https://www.vast-inc.com/) and a major advocate for empowering domain experts with data science tools like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
